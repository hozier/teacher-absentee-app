# teacher-absentee-app
My first tinkering with Apple's Objective C was Late Summer 2013. iOS platform. The application's purpose: Allow students real-time updates on professors which are absent or late for the day through push-notifications. The concept stems from the many students who have muttered, "I really wish I knew Professor XYZ wasn't here this morning, I could've slept in later." This holds true especially at a commuter college. At my previous college, the only notification of late or absent professors was through a page on the College's website.  Yes, it actually was inherently left to the student to be diligent every morning and check this list.  The need for a better service has led to thinking through convient solutions in code. At the core of the app is the customizable ability to parse through html data while creating scalable data structures to hold the absent or late professor of the day. The entire implementation has not been completed. But committed currently is a working version on the concept application.
